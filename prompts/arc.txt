You are given several training input/output grid pairs that follow a single hidden rule.
Digits 0–9 denote colors with no numeric meaning.
IMPORTANT:
• The TEST output may have different size than input (e.g., scaling, tiling, framing).
• Do NOT simply copy the input.
Task: Apply the rule and return ONLY the output grid as JSON per schema.
